# packet capture
Capture raw packets from layer 3 and above using python.
For the time being it only works on windows but I will soon update it for other platform as well.


### Installation
#### Windows
- Download the repo.
- Open CMD as administrator
- Navigate to the folder
- Type:
```cmd
pip install socket
```
or if you don't have python on PATH you can use this command instead
```cmd
py -m pip install socket
```
- To use refer to <a href=''>Wiki</a>
